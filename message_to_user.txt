I've modified `client_code/Menu/form_template.yaml`. The "Painel Principal" menu item is now rendered as a `Label` component instead of a `Button`, but it still retains its `click` event binding and styling properties.

Please refresh your application and try to click the "Painel Principal" menu item.
*   If you *can* click it, it means there's an issue specific to Anvil's `Button` components that prevents them from being interactive in this context.
*   If you *cannot* click it, the problem is more general, affecting even `Label` components with click handlers in the menu.

Please let me know the result.
