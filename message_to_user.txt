I've inserted a diagnostic "TEST CLICK" button into `theme/assets/standard-page.html`. It's a bright red button positioned at the top-left of the screen, with a very high z-index.

Please refresh your application and try to click this "TEST CLICK" button.
*   If you *can* click it and an alert box appears, it means the issue is likely specific to the Anvil menu components, and not a broad overlay blocking the entire area.
*   If you *cannot* click it, then there's still a broader overlay issue at play, even with a highly-prioritized HTML element.

Please let me know the result.
