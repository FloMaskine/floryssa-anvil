I've added a CSS rule to `theme/assets/theme.css` (`.left-nav .btn, .left-nav a { pointer-events: auto !important; }`) to explicitly enable pointer events on the menu buttons and links. This should override any other rules that might be disabling interaction.

Please refresh your application and check if the menu is now clickable and buttons react to hovering.
